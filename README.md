# sfs2-proxy
This is a proxy developed to intercept the game protocol used in SmartFoxServer 2X. It was created
for a specific app, so it may need some adjustments for other configurations.


# Setup
Download the [installer](https://www.smartfoxserver.com/download/sfs2x#p=installer). From within here you can 
   find the necessary SmartFoxServer libraries and import them into eclipse.

# TODO
* Add functionality to decrypt traffic
